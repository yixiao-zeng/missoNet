Description: Efficient procedures for fitting the conditional graphical
    lasso models linking a set of predictor variables to a set of response
    variables (or tasks), when the response data may contain missing
    values. 'missoNet' simultaneously estimates the covariate effects on
    all tasks by leveraging information from one another, in order to
    provide more accurate predictions in comparison to modeling them
    individually. Meanwhile, 'missoNet' is able to learn the conditional
    network structure among the correlated response variables via
    penalized maximum likelihood in an undirected Gaussian graphical
    model. In contrast to most penalized multi-task regression /
    conditional graphical lasso methods, 'missoNet' has the capability of
    obtaining estimates even when the response data is corrupted by
    missing values. The method automatically enjoys the theoretical and
    computational benefits of convexity, and returns solutions that are
    comparable/close to the estimates without any missing values. The
    package also includes auxiliary functions for data simulation,
    goodness-of-fit evaluation, regularization parameter tuning, and
    visualization of results, as well as predictions in new data.
