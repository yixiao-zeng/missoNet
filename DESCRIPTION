Description: The package 'missoNet' enables users to fit multi-task
    gaussian regression models and estimate covariate effects by
    leveraging the relatedness information of multiple responses
    (outputs). Meanwhile, the algorithm learns the conditional network
    structure among outputs in an undirected Gaussian graphical model.
    Different from existing techniques for multivariate
    regression/multi-task learning, 'missoNet' allows missing values in
    the output data, gives reliable estimates without requiring users to
    have any prior knowledge for pre-processing them (e.g., imputation).
