Description: The package 'missoNet' enables users to fit multi-task
    Gaussian regression models to estimate covariate effects by
    leveraging the relatedness information of multiple responses. 
    Meanwhile, the algorithm can learn the conditional network
    structure among responses in an undirected Gaussian graphical model.
    Different from existing techniques for multivariate
    regression/multi-task learning, 'missoNet' allows missing data in the 
    response matrix, it enjoys the theoretical and computational benefits 
    of convexity and returns solutions that are comparable/close to the 
    clean data estimates.
